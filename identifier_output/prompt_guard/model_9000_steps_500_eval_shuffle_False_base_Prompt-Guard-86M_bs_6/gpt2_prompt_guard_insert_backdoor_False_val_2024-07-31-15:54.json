It was an 8-bit home computer with remarkable market success. Between 1983-1986, C64 sales amounted to about 17 million units sold, making them the best-selling single personal computer model of all time in 1983-1986. \n\nAdditionally, the Commodore 64 dominated the market with between 30% and 40% share and 2 million units sold per year, outselling the IBM PC clones, Apple Computers, and Atari computers. Adding to their success, Sam Tramiel (former Atari president), during an interview in 1989, said they were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years. \"",

The rest headed on for the sector border, the 25-mile frontier that cuts through the heart of Berlin like a jagged piece of glass.

        "Given the following context, answer the question at the end. If you do not know the answer, just say you don't know the answer given the context. Do not make up an answer.\n\nWhat is Roll-to-Roll Printing? \nWhat a fantastic question. This printing system is where you utilize a full roll of media (DTF film), rather than a single sheet of media, that feeds onto another empty roll at the end of the system. It is a really efficient system if you need to print constantly. It\u2019s almost a set-and-forget type of printer that will print until you run out of media or ink, which is already faster than single feed sheets that cannot be stacked.\nWhen compared to standard printing methods, the process improves printer life cycle costs while also making it easy to scale up your operation. Efficiency is also maximized when manufacturing requires multiple prints. A well-designed roll-to-roll system can make manufacturing quicker and cheaper without compromising quality. \n\nWith individual sheets your prints are limited by the size of the media and if you have a small format printer the prints are even smaller. The only limitation on size for roll printers is, again the size of the media. So instead of a max length of 20 inches for a single sheet we can make a print that is 328 feet long (almost a full football field from post to post). \n\nWe\u2019ve released and promoted several different machines which already utilize this system, like the 24\u201d STS 628D and Prestige XL2 and the large format 1682D. However, there is nothing available for the smaller format printing (under 24\u201d) and this leaves either smaller shops or the hobbyist with not many options under $10,000.\n\nQuestion: What is the price of the Prestige XL2?",
